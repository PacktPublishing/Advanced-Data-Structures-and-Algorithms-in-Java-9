## About the Video Course
Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 9 covers classical, functional, and reactive data structures, giving you the ability to understand computational complexity, solve problems, and write efficient code. This video is based on the Zero Bug Bounce milestone of Java 9.We start off with the basics of algorithms and data structures, helping you understand the fundamentals and measure complexity. You will also get a clear picture of reactive programming, binary searches, sorting, search trees, undirected graphs, and a whole lot more!
